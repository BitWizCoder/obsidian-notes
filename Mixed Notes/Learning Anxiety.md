Muhammad, what you're describing is actually very common among serious, self-motivated learners — especially those who care about deep understanding, not just completion. Let's break this down into two parts:

---

## 🧠 What You're Feeling — Terms That Fit

1.  **Learning Anxiety**

   * **Definition:** A sense of stress or overwhelm when faced with new or complex information.
   * **Symptoms in your case:** Feeling left behind, the urge to revisit previous lessons, stuck in a loop.

1.  **Impostor Syndrome**

   * **You might be thinking:** "Everyone else gets this faster than me — am I not good enough?"
   * This fear fuels the feeling of falling behind.

1.  **Perfectionism in Learning**

   * The urge to **fully master** every concept before moving on — which ironically can slow down your overall progress.
   * You're afraid to "build on a shaky foundation," so you keep going back.

1.  **Analysis Paralysis** (especially when switching resources)

   * Too many options (videos, docs, tutorials), and you're not sure which one is best — so you hesitate or loop endlessly.

## 🔧 How to Overcome This Feeling — Practical Steps

### 1. **Adopt an Iterative Learning Approach (Spiral Learning)**

> Don’t aim for 100% mastery on the first pass. Instead:

* Do a **first pass** to get general exposure.
* Then **loop back** later for a deeper understanding.
* This helps build momentum without perfectionism stopping you.

---

### 2. **Trust the Course Flow — Pause with Purpose**

* It's **normal** to not fully get everything instantly.
* Instead of jumping to other resources **immediately**, mark the unclear points.
* Continue with the course, and come back later — often later content clarifies earlier confusion.

---

### 3. **Use Active Recall & Teaching**

* After each lesson, write 2–3 sentences in your own words.
* Try explaining it to someone (or just out loud to yourself).
* This reinforces memory **more than rewatching or re-reading**.

---

### 4. **Set “Good Enough” Benchmarks**

* Ask: *"Can I summarize this concept in 3 lines?"*
  If yes — move on.
* Learning is a journey — perfection isn’t the goal; progress is.

---

### 5. **Limit Resource Switching**

* Pick *one* primary course.
* If you get stuck, search a **single** alternate explanation (YouTube, blog), then come back.
* Avoid falling into the "one more perfect tutorial" trap.

---

### 6. **Community Learning Helps**

* Join a Discord, forum, or subreddit for the course or topic.
* Seeing others struggle too normalizes your experience.

## 🧘‍♂️ Mindset Shift

> "Feeling behind" usually means you're **engaged** and care enough to go deep — not that you're failing.

In fact, most fast learners forget just as fast. Your slow, intentional pace builds **real retention**.

If you’d like, I can help you design a *learning system* or planner that balances depth and progress for your current course. Just let me know the course name again.
