You're thinking clearly, Muhammad — what you’ve described is a **deep learning strategy**, and it’s the right move when surface-level knowledge is no longer enough. You’re past the passive learning phase, and now entering the **active consolidation** phase. Let's structure everything you're trying to do into a focused, balanced, and sustainable plan.

---

## 🎯 Your Learning Goals Right Now

1. 🔁 **Revisit and internalize past React lectures/projects**
    
2. 📝 **Take meaningful notes** and actively summarize key ideas
    
3. 💡 **Practice + repeat projects** from the course until you're confident
    
4. 🧱 **Build hands-on projects with vanilla JavaScript** to strengthen programming logic and core understanding

## ✅ Your Custom Strategy — 4-Week Sprint Plan

We’ll use this loop weekly to build consistency while hitting all goals.

---

### 🔹 **Weekly Plan Template**

|Day|Focus Area|Time Block Idea|
|---|---|---|
|**Mon**|React Lecture Rewatch + Notes|1.5–2 hours|
|**Tue**|Rebuild React Project from that Topic|2–3 hours|
|**Wed**|JavaScript Mini Project|2–3 hours|
|**Thu**|React Concept Practice (from past topics, isolated examples)|1–2 hours|
|**Fri**|Vanilla JS DOM project (interactive)|2–3 hours|
|**Sat**|Review + Notes Recap + Git push|1–2 hours (relaxed)|
|**Sun**|Light Review or Rest|Optional|

---

### 🔸 Task 1: **Revisit Past Lectures with Purpose**

Instead of passively watching:

- Watch at 1x or 1.25x speed
    
- Pause and **take notes in your own words**
    
- Write 1–2 questions per lesson (what was unclear?)
    
- Build **mini-concepts separately** (e.g., just practice `useEffect` in isolation)
    

✅ Tools:

- Notion or Obsidian for structured notes
    
- CodePen / StackBlitz for micro-experiments
    

---

### 🔸 Task 2: **Repeat the Course Projects (But Smarter)**

Do them again but:

- **Without watching the tutorial** first. Rely on memory.
    
- Then compare with the instructor version
    
- Add **one small twist** — new color scheme, a new feature, different data
    

✅ Why? You’re learning to **apply**, not just follow.

---

### 🔸 Task 3: **Build 3–4 Vanilla JS Projects (over next 4 weeks)**

Here are some recommended ones:

|Project|Concepts You’ll Practice|
|---|---|
|✅ To-Do App|DOM, array methods, event handling|
|✅ Weather App|fetch API, async/await, input handling|
|✅ Modal + Form|DOM events, validation, UX|
|✅ Quiz App|logic, data flow, event control|

These help you **strengthen logic + DOM manipulation**, which will massively help React understanding.

---

### 🔸 Task 4: **Reflect and Push**

Every Saturday:

- Review what you did (1–2 short paragraphs)
    
- Push code to GitHub
    
- Optionally post a progress log on Twitter, LinkedIn, or a dev group
    

---

## 🧠 Mindset Reminders for This Plan

- You’re **rebuilding your base** — it’s worth the time.
    
- It’s okay to go **slower and deeper** now so you go faster later.
    
- Course timelines are generic — your learning is personal.
    
- By repeating + applying, you’re doing **what most learners skip**.
