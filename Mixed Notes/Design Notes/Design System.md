Yes, Muhammad ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **solid plan** for building scalable and consistent landing pages efficiently. You're thinking like a **design system strategist**, which is exactly the right approach for multi-page design work. Let‚Äôs break down why it‚Äôs good, and how you can achieve it step by step.

## ‚úÖ Why Your Plan Is Good

1. **Component-first approach**: Reusable components speed up the workflow, reduce inconsistencies, and help maintain a clean visual hierarchy.
    
2. **Design cohesion**: Having one source of truth for UI elements ensures that all pages feel part of the same product family.
    
3. **Future-proofing**: You'll be able to easily scale the system and design new pages without starting from scratch each time.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Achieve This ‚Äî Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. **Gather Inspiration (Moodboard/Benchmarking)**

- **Goal**: Understand common UX/UI patterns in landing pages.
    
- **What to do**:
    
    - Collect 10‚Äì20 great landing pages from Dribbble, Mobbin, Landbook, etc.
        
    - Tag elements: hero sections, CTAs, navbars, testimonials, feature blocks, etc.
        
    - Note the layout patterns, visual styles, and interaction ideas that resonate with your vision.
        

### 2. **Create a Component Inventory**

- **Goal**: List all components you'll need.
    
- **Common components**:
    
    - Navigation bars
        
    - Hero sections
        
    - CTA blocks
        
    - Pricing tables
        
    - Testimonials
        
    - FAQ accordions
        
    - Feature grids
        
    - Footers
        
    - Forms (newsletter/contact)
        
- Optional: Build variants (light/dark, with/without images, etc.)
    

### 3. **Design Components First (Your Core UI Kit)**

- Use Figma and create:
    
    - A **design system file** with:
        
        - Color tokens (primary, secondary, backgrounds)
            
        - Typography styles
            
        - Spacing rules
            
        - Shadows, borders, corner radii
            
    - A **component file** with:
        
        - All the components you need
            
        - Auto layout + constraints
            
        - Proper naming + organization
            
- Reuse as much as possible ‚Äî this speeds up design and makes updates easy later.
    

### 4. **Build the First 10 Pages**

- Use your components to assemble the 10 landing pages.
    
- Each page should focus on a slightly different goal or audience (product variant, feature, campaign, etc.).
    
- Tweak components locally **only if needed** ‚Äî try to stay consistent.
    

### 5. **Create Additional Pages Later Using Same Components**

- Once the base is done, keep the **component file as your master source**.
    
- Link new files/pages to that system for easy updates.
    
- Example: You add a new CTA variant later ‚Äî all pages using that component get it automatically (or easily swapped).
    

### 6. **Expand and Refine Components**

- As needs evolve, **log component gaps** during new page creation.
    
- Occasionally, return to your component file and:
    
    - Add new variants
        
    - Improve accessibility
        
    - Optimize naming/structure

## üéØ Pro Tips for Smooth Workflow

- **Use Figma Styles and Auto Layout** aggressively for responsive designs.
    
- **Publish your design system** if you‚Äôre working across files or with a team.
    
- Use **component naming conventions** like `CTA / Large / With Image` for clarity.
    
- Consider building a **light design system doc or guide** to document usage rules.

## üß© Optional: Plan for Dev Handoff or Coding

Since you're a MERN dev too:

- Once the designs are finalized, you can **translate your components into code (React + Tailwind)** using the same structure.
    
- This will give you a **design-to-code pipeline** that is efficient and scalable.
