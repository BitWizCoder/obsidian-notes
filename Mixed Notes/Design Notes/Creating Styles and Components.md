Absolutely, Muhammad. Let’s go deeper into **Step 3: Design Components First (Your Core UI Kit)** — this is the **heart** of your efficient workflow.

---

## 🎯 Goal: Build a set of well-structured, reusable components in Figma that can be used across all 10+ landing pages (and future pages too).

Think of this step as **building a Lego set** before you build the full castle. You’re designing each brick carefully, so later you can assemble pages faster and more consistently.

## 🔧 What This Involves

### **1. Create a Design System File**

This file holds your **styles and tokens** – the visual language of your brand.

#### 🔹 Define Styles:

- **Color Styles**:
    
    - Primary / Secondary
        
    - Accent / Error / Success
        
    - Background / Surface / Borders / Text (Light & Dark versions)
        
- **Text Styles**:
    
    - Headings (H1–H6)
        
    - Paragraphs (Body 1, 2), captions, links
        
- **Effects**:
    
    - Shadows, borders, blurs
        
- **Grids/Spacing**:
    
    - 8pt system (or 4pt), section spacing, padding guidelines
        

👉 Use Figma’s “Styles” feature so they can be reused across all components.

### **2. Create a Component Library File**

Now build **actual UI components** — modular blocks you’ll use on the pages.

#### 🔹 Common Landing Page Components:

Organize by category like this:

|Group|Components|
|---|---|
|**Navigation**|Navbar (centered, split, sticky)|
|**Hero Section**|With image, with video, centered content|
|**CTA**|With headline + button, multiple button variants|
|**Features**|Grid style, icon + text, card-style|
|**Testimonials**|Carousel, grid, single quote|
|**Pricing**|2-column, 3-column pricing tables|
|**Forms**|Newsletter signup, contact form|
|**FAQ**|Accordion-style FAQ|
|**Footers**|Simple, detailed with links, dark/light variant|

> 💡 Pro tip: Design **multiple variants** if you plan to reuse a component in different styles (e.g., “Hero / With Image”, “Hero / Centered Text”).

### **3. Build Components Using Figma Best Practices**

Here’s where you apply smart design techniques.

#### ✅ Use Auto Layout:

- Helps make components responsive and easy to update.
    
- Add padding, spacing, alignment rules.
    
- Works great for forms, cards, feature blocks, buttons, etc.
    

#### ✅ Use Variants:

- Group similar components into one “master” using **Variants**.
    
- Example: Button with `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Disabled`, `With Icon`.
    

#### ✅ Use Constraints:

- Set constraints so components behave correctly when resized (especially important for responsive design).
    

#### ✅ Naming Convention:

Stick to a naming system like:

```
Component Group / Component Name / Variant
e.g.  Hero / Centered / With CTA
      Button / Primary / With Icon
```

This makes search, reuse, and organization easy.

### **4. Structure the File for Reusability**

Organize your layers in Figma with:

- Clear folders/frames for each section (Nav, Hero, CTA, etc.)
    
- Label everything properly
    
- Separate **published** components (ready-to-use) vs. drafts/test versions
    

Use pages like:

- `🧱 Components`
    
- `🎨 Styles`
    
- `📄 Templates`
    
- `🧪 Playground`
    

---

### **5. Publish the Library**

Once you're done designing the components:

- Publish the file as a Figma Library.
    
- Then link it to your page design files (where you'll build the 10 landing pages).
    
- This way, every update to a component is available across all pages.
    

---

## 🧠 Summary:

You're building a **component-first UI system**, where everything is modular, scalable, and consistent. This makes designing pages 5x faster and ensures that your future updates are low effort but high impact.
