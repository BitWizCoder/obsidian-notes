Great question, Muhammad — and it’s very important early on.

You're about to **recreate and study** others' designs — which is **perfect for learning**, but it does raise valid questions around **how and where to share them** without misrepresenting or violating ownership.

## ✅ Here's How You Can Share Recreated Designs (Safely & Professionally):

### 1. **Label It Clearly as a Re-creation**

When posting, **always credit the original designer** and **state clearly** that it's a re-creation.

> **Example caption for Instagram/Behance/Dribbble:**  
> “🎨 Re-creation study of [Designer Name]’s poster – done for practice in Adobe Illustrator to improve my layout & typography skills. All rights to original design remain with the creator.”

This makes your intention **transparent**, and it’s respected by the design community.

### 2. **Platforms to Share Your Work**

Start building your **graphic design presence** here:

- **Instagram** → Focus on visuals + short captions
    
- **Behance** → For case studies and full project breakdowns
    
- **Dribbble** → For polished visuals, posters, brand mocks
    
- **X (Twitter)** → For process, progress shots, and community feedback
    
- **LinkedIn** → To show career-level growth and connect with other designers
    

You can even tag it under something like:

> #RecreationStudy #PosterRecreation #DesignPractice

### 3. **Use “Before & After” or “Side-by-Side” Layouts**

This helps make your intent even clearer. Show:

- Original design (small or watermarked, if needed)
    
- Your re-created version next to it
    
- Write what you learned (type, spacing, grid use, etc.)

### 4. **Eventually Add Your Own Twist**

As you improve, try:

- Changing color palette
    
- Using different typefaces
    
- Swapping elements while keeping layout
    
- Creating **original posters inspired by the design**
    

This helps move you from **copy** → **influence** → **originality**.

---

### 5. **Don’t Sell or Brand It as Your Own Work**

Never use re-creations in:

- Paid work
    
- Portfolio sections that say "Client Work"
    
- Commercial projects (even mock ones)
    

Only use them in **“Personal Study”** or “Design Challenge” categories.

### 🧠 Pro Insight:

Re-creating great design is one of the fastest ways to grow as a designer — **just be transparent**, respectful, and self-aware when sharing.
