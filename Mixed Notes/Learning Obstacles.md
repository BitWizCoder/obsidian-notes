Yes, what you're describing is a very common experience, and while there isn't a single clinical term for **all** of it, several psychological concepts relate closely:

---

### 1. **Imposter Syndrome**

- **What it is**: Feeling like you're not as competent as others think, often leading to anxiety when comparing yourself to others.
    
- **Relates to your case**: When you rush to "keep up," it may trigger doubt, like you're faking your way through or don't really belong.

### 2. **Cognitive Overload**

- **What it is**: When you try to absorb too much at once, especially without a strong foundation.
    
- **Relates to your case**: Rushing without doing things properly from the start can overwhelm your working memory and lead to confusion and loss of confidence.

### 3. **Comparison Anxiety**

- **What it is**: Stress and insecurity caused by comparing your progress or success to others.
    
- **Relates to your case**: Trying to match others’ pace instead of your own can make you feel like you're falling behind, even if you're not.

### 4. **Perfectionism vs. Process Orientation**

- **What it is**: Some people need clarity, order, and depth to feel confident. If the process is disrupted or rushed, it can destabilize them.
    
- **Relates to your case**: You thrive when you do things _your way_, with care and understanding from the start. Skipping that creates a shaky internal structure.
    

---

### 5. **Self-Efficacy**

- **What it is**: Your belief in your ability to complete tasks successfully.
    
- **Relates to your case**: When you work at your own pace, you reinforce your self-efficacy. When you rush, that belief gets undermined.
